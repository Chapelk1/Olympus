          <h3>Staking</h3>
          <p>
            Stakers play an important role in the Olympus ecosystem. Stakers
            deposit their OHM into the protocol, which contributes to OHMâ€™s
            long-term price stability. In exchange, stakers receive their pro
            rata share of rebases and governance rights.

          <h3>Bonding</h3>
          <p>
            Bonding allows you to trade various tokens for OHM at a discounted
            price. In exchange, bond sales provide additional liquidity and
            reserve assets to the Olympus treasury, contributing to the
            stability of the protocol. As a result, 99% of all liquidity is
            owned by Olympus.
